        <h1> Top 7 Anime Series </h1>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered why so many adults all over the world find Japanese anime so fascinating and enjoyable? There are a number of possible answers: some might find the vivid colors intense; others may learn new things about Japanese culture; while still others might enjoy exercising their imagination and exploring meaningful concepts found in the anime. In the world of anime, nothing is impossible, and if you’re willing to try hard to achieve your goals, you will eventually make it. Unlike American cartoons, pretty often (if not always) the best anime has lots of depth, and there’s always a deeper meaning you can discover.
Whatever the real reasons are that so many people love anime, the only sure thing is that there are millions of fans worldwide, just as there are millions of fans of American cartoons, graphic novels, and so on. Because I enjoy wacthing it, I decided to make a website that shows some of my favorite anime, and if you happen to be one of the many people who hasn’t come to the magical world of anime yet, just use my list as a foundation to find your way in. You won’t regret it.

          <p id="Wolf Children">
        <p>
          About a young woman named Hana who falls in love with her mysterious college classmate who is actually a wolf man. The couple produce two children who also possess their father's lineage; the big sister Yuki, who was born on a snowy day, and the little brother, Ame, who was born on a rainy day.
The wolf man suddenly dies one day, leaving Hana to raise the two wolf children herself and struggle to keep their secret. But when the family is threatened by eviction, child services, and neighbors annoyed by Ame's constant crying (and often both Wolf Children's howling, which the landlady mistakes for pets), Hana decides to move out to the secluded country side where her kids can roam free.
